Introduction
============

Description
-----------
The class list web service provides a class information for external eZ Publish
installations.


Requirements
============
The ReST web service must return an XML document describing the result. The 
service must include the possibility to retrieve:
- List of class information
  - List of class names ( including translations ).
  - Class indetifier
  - Class attribute identifiers
  - Class attribute names
  - Class attribute data types
It must also have the possibility to require authentication when being used.

All lists must be able to accept offset and limit parameters.


Considerations
==============
No caching of the result should be done by this service. Caching should be
performed by the client. Some caching of the user permissions is already done
by eZ Publish.


Requirements
============
ReST server.
