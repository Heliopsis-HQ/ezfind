Introduction
============

Until eZ Find 2.1, a signle schema is used which is non optimal for
multi-lingual sites as every language needs to have its dedicated language dependent
analyzer filters

With support for multiple cores, this problem can easily tackled as each core (index)
has its own schema.xml file, optimized per language

Details
=======

solr.ini multi-core definitions
-------------------------------

MultiCore=yes|no

Thsi means the base url becomes the multi-core base url, this is not yet the
instance itself

Cores[]
Cores[identifier]=<url suffix>
....

ezfind.ini language mappings
----------------------------

in section [LanguageSearch]

Adding

UseMultiCore=yes|no

LanguageMapCores[]
LanguageMapCores[identifier]=eng-GB
....

API changes
-----------

* eZSolr
* Querybuilder
* fetch functions
* ...

Indexing over multiple cores
----------------------------

* In the case of one language per core, the addObject function call needs to be adapted

Searching over multiple cores
-----------------------------

* Search across languages (usually a single language will be searched for only)

Since each core will store its own data per language, we need select operations
to use all the cores at the same time, while maintaining language priority search

Because every language version shares essentially the same schema file, all
filtering, sorting and faceting remains available

* search across other indexes

For foreign indexes, the aggregated fields are to be used

* common

Searching has to be made using sharding; the request is sent to one core, but
instructs it to shard it to other cores::

    http://host:8983/solr/core0/select?shards=host:8983/solr/core0,host:8983/solr/core1&q=...

Limitations of distributed search (not only cores, also independent servlets)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

See Solr Wiki: http://wiki.apache.org/solr/DistributedSearch

* no elevation support (might be supported after all, to test)
* no date faceting (to test, may be solved in Solr 1.4)
* no spellcheck (to follow: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SOLR-785 )
