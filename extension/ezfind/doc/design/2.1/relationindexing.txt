CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION
======================
When an object with a related object is indexed, the related objects are fetched,
and their metadata are concatenated to one big string. The indexed object is
most likely (FIXME: check) the main language of the siteaccess the object is
published from.

ISSUES
======

Languages
---------
When indexing related objects, current settings won't let us determine what
language has to be used to index related objects.

3 sites languages, fre-FR, ger-DE, eng-GB.
fre-FR siteaccess, lang priority: fre-FR, ger-DE, eng-GB.
backoffice in english by default.

An object A is created in fre-FR, related to B, in ger-DE and eng-GB.

 * Issue 1: How can eZ find know that it has to index the related object data in
ger-DE and not in eng-GB
 * issue 2: Admitting that Issue 1 is fixed, what happens if B is edited, and
fre-FR is added ? Do we have to reindex A, since the indexed content has
changed (translation of related content added).
