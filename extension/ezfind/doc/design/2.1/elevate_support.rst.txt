Introduction
============

Description
-----------

Add elevate support to eZ Find. Read this for low-level info about how it is
supported in Solr : [1_].

Excerpt :
 "The QueryElevationComponent enables you to configure the top results for a 
 given query regardless of the normal lucene scoring. This component matches 
 the user query text to a configured Map of top results."



Design
======

Solr side
---------
The elevate feature takes the form of a searchComponent in solrconfig.xml. It
needs to be added as a 'last-components' in the requestHandler dedicated to
eZFind, called 'ezpublish'. Right after spellcheck in the current state of
eZFind.

The elevator configuration provided as example in the current solrconfig.xml is
suited to the usage we might have of it. For details on the configuration
directives, refer to [1_].


eZ Publish side
---------------

The idea is to be able to associate query words to a given content object, so
that it is elevated when a query exactly containing these keywords is
performed. It must also be possible to make sure an object is not returned as
search result when a specific query is made ( ``<doc id="B" exclude="true" />`` ) A global eZFind dashboard in the administration interface could be
the place to achieve this. Alternatively/jointly, a new action on every content
object could satisfy this need, either as a button in the full view of the
object, either as a new action in the Javascript menu of every Object/node.

The default sort parameter passed from eZFind ( 'score desc' ) does not collide
with the elevate function. However, when another sort parameter is passed,
elevate's behaviour is overridden by the sort method ( [2_] ). If elevate should
be applied whatever the sort parameter is, a new parameter must be passed as
parameter in the query ::

 forceElevation=true

This parameter should be added to the search() method of the search plugin, and
all overlying fetch functions.


Syncing the elevate configuration
---------------------------------

Priming elevate.xml
'''''''''''''''''''
``elevate.xml`` will be placed, with an empty configuration, in java/solr/conf.
By default, from ezfind 2.0aplha, the index directory is placed in /srv/solr.
Before lauching solr the first time, a manual installation step is to move elevate.xml in the dataDir.
The dataDir can be found in the following configuration directive in
solrconfig.xml in ``<dataDir>${solr.data.dir:/srv/solr}</dataDir>``


Syncing
'''''''

Solr uses an XML configuration file ( elevate.xml ). A few constraints increase
the difficulty-level of this task : 

1. Solr can be running on a different machine than the one running eZ Publish
2. Solr needs to be relaunched for the new configuration to be loaded.

**Phase 1**

A direct update of the local configuration file. Constraints :

* Solr must be running on the same machine as the eZ Publish instance.
* Write access on elevate.xml is required.
* The actual path to elevate.xml needs to be known of eZ Publish. This could be provided as a configuration directive if needed.

**Phase 2**

A solution satisfying point 1. above shall be implemented : pushing the configuration in Solr through ReST. 
This implies developing a custom requestHandler in Solr, taking as input the updated elevate.xml file ( POST ), 
replacing it, and reloading the configuration. Possible security issue here. Low impact.

Another solution based on rsync was envisaged at some point. Due to the utility
of having an eZFind-dedicated, extensible requestHandler in the Solr version we
ship, this solution was put aside.


Configuration storage
'''''''''''''''''''''
A new table, dedicated to storing the elevate configuration, is required.

+----------------+------------+
| search_query   | object_id  |
+================+============+
| foo bar        | 73         |
+----------------+------------+
| foo bar        | 83         |
+----------------+------------+
| foo            | 69         |
+----------------+------------+

Primary key : 

* search_query + object_id

Indeces : 

* search_query + object_id
* search_query
* object_id

**Open questions :**

* Case-sensitivity ?

How to make sure Solr is taking the updated conf into account ?
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

**Phase 1**

In a first phase, placing elevate.xml in the dataDir and triggering a commit to
reload the elevate configuration will be implemented.

**Phase 2**

If elevate.xml is stored in the configuration directory, a manual relaunch of Solr is required. 
An existing core admin request handler seems to be existing ( [3_] ). It would
allow for an automatic config reload without interrupting the service at all.
The folowing modifications would be required in order to be able to use the
core administration : 

1. Add a multicore configuration file ``ezfind/java/solr/solr.xml``, containing for instance 

::

   <solr persistent="true" sharedLib="lib">
        <cores adminPath="/admin/cores">
                <core name="ezfind" instanceDir="." />
        </cores>
   </solr>



2. Append the name of the solr core to ``solr.ini[SolrBase].SearchServerURI``
   as well as in the default parameter value in ``eZSolrBase::eZSolrBase(..)`` :

:: 
 
 http://localhost:8983/solr/ezfind/

3. Here is a code snippet which actually reloads a Solr core : 

::

   $solr = new eZSolrBase( 'http://localhost:8983/solr/' );
   $params = array( 'fake' => 'param' );
   $solr->rawSolrRequest( 'admin/cores?action=RELOAD&core=ezfind', $params ); 


Possible security here ( DOS / relatively low impact ).

**Phase 2, alternative**

Leveraging the requestHandler dedicated to uploading a new conf is an option.
This requestHandler could take care of reloading the configuration once it was updated.


Elevate Dashboard
-----------------
For the time being, adding en entry in the javascript menu available in the
content structure menu ( left click on a node ) is not easily doable. Nor is
adding a button in the full view of a node in the administration interface. In a
first round, centralizing the configuration of elevate in the soon-to-be eZFind
dashbard appears to be the only solution.

// TODO : insert here a picture of the GUI design.
//        ideas : multi-tabbed dashboard, one tab for elevate.
//        ajax-search for finding which objects are elevated on a given query.
//        reversed : which queries trigger elevation for one given object.
// questions : need for accessibility ( meaning no ajax/js )?


Migration notes
---------------
Adding support for elevate does not require a full re-indexing. Upgrading
eZFind, taking over the former index data, and relaunching the Solr service is
sufficient.
Should the configuration be stored on another machine, the configuration will
need to be initialized locally ( DB, local file, depending on the decision made
above ).

NB : the sql script creating the configuration storage table will have to be
run, unless an automatic creation is chosen.
